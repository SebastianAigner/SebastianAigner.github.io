    <p>When Samuel first introduced me to Munchkin (even on an abstract level, just in conversation), I was taken aback by the seeming complexity of the game.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-munchkin">What is Munchkin?</h3>
<p>Munchkin is a card game where you try to reach level 10 before anyone else does, by fighting monsters. But, you don’t only fight the monsters, other players can also influence the outcome of each individual spat by buffing the monsters or helping out the players. It becomes a crazy game of alliances, mind games, raging moments of unfairness and imbalance, and wonderful fun. If you’re interested, I suggest you check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(card_game)">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<h3 id="this-evening">This evening</h3>
<p>So, after doing the <a href="http://yearcompass.com">YearCompass</a> for 2018, and a failed electronics experiment due to a malfunctioning Raspberry Pi, I talked to Samuel, he complained about his new microphone, and we got a round of people going to play a round of Munchkin. What none of us knew at this point is that the round would take <em>four hours</em>, with an extremely intense endgame. I was very lucky to come out on top, only enabled by my brother in arms Peter who promptly decided it was more important that <em>the other’s don’t win</em>. With his support, I was buffed to a level where even the combined forces of four other players couldn’t defeat me anymore - though in all fairness, they already shot their bolts in the previous rounds, as did we all. It was a tough fight, people threw curses and monsters at each other left and right - probably one of the most memorable moments was Olly, a new guy I met just days before playing Uno on Tabletop Simulator, being defeated by a monster that took away virtually all his goods, and Gilbert playing a card to apply the same effects to Samuel; in a late game like ours, this was devastating.</p>

<p>It was extremely fun, and after the dust settled, I noticed my hot ears (from having headphones on throughout the whole intense session), a general sense of tiredness, but pride. I decided to go out for a 45 minute walk through the cold winter night. To be honest, I don’t really know where my in-ear headphones are right now, but instead of searching for them I decided I should just take a break from all the media bashing into my head, and just enjoy the calm gloom. So I did. It was a great evening, extremely enjoyable.</p>

<h3 id="a-side-note-the-name-munchkin">A Side Note: The name “Munchkin”</h3>
<p>Samuel told me about this, because I didn’t really spend too much time thinking about the name, but it actually comes from other Tabletop Roleplaying Games:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In gaming, a munchkin is a player who plays what is intended to be a non-competitive game (usually a role-playing game) in an aggressively competitive manner. A munchkin seeks within the context of the game to amass the greatest power, score the most “kills”, and grab the most loot, no matter how detrimental their actions are to role-playing, the storyline, fairness, teamwork, or the other players’ enjoyment. The term is used almost exclusively as a pejorative and frequently is used in reference to powergamers.
(Thanks, Wikipedia)</p>

<p>Suddenly, the whole setting, and the humorous cards all made a whole lot more sense to me.</p>

    <p>Amidst what seems like a heavy outage on the internet (with a very spotty connection), I managed to glue together a small demo after today’s coding session together with Alex in the Loretta Bar here in Munich. I was infatuated with the last task we worked on, the <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/11">Day 11</a> challenge from Advent of Code 2017. I had already read a few articles regarding hexagonal grids, but none of them really made me understand the topic as well as just looking at a piece of paper (or even a napkin), scribbling around and trying to figure things out.</p>

<p>After I had managed to build an (albeit inefficient) solution for myself, I set out to understand more about the topic. When I managed to have somewhat of a breakthrough in understanding, and felt a lot better reasoning about the topic, I decided it would be time to improve upon the visualisations that I had seen on other blogs like <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">Redblobgames</a>. They’re still a great read any heavily recommended, but I thought I’d try my hand at one of these as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Important constraint: x+y+z = 0 (also defines the plane)</li>
  <li>Play around for movement</li>
  <li>Switch the camera around</li>
  <li>Note that the equation x+y+z = 0 is always correct</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="distances">Distances</h4>
<ul>
  <li>3D representation allows us to easily reason about distances</li>
  <li>You can see that to each neighbouring cube the manhattan distance is 2 -&gt; the grid distance is 1.</li>
  <li>

<h3 id="how-this-demo-is-made">How this demo is made</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unity</li>
  <li>Boxes</li>
  <li>Changing materials when mousing over</li>
  <li>Drawing linerenderer in the correct positions</li>
  <li>Switching around axes because I don’t agree with Unitys Y axis</li>
  <li>Easter egg: my old hiwi office as backdrop</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="challenges-in-building-the-demo">Challenges in building the demo</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Line renderer wouldn’t render color in WebGL export -&gt; change material</li>
  <li>UI doesn’t properly scale on all devices (beginner’s problem in Unity)</li>

    <p>Tâ€™was the night of the 24th of december, I was sitting together with my family at my grandparentâ€™s house and celebrated Christmas - and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christkind">Christkind</a> blessed me with a Fire HD 10 Tablet, freshly made by Amazon (or whoever manufactures these things). It should serve as a replacement device for my Sony Xperia Tablet Z which unfortunately had an unplanned rendezvous with the floor.</p>

<p>So I set out to make this thing my classic YouTube watching machine that I was used to before. Which is when I encounteredâ€¦</p>

<h3 id="the-shock">The Shock</h3>
<p>Upon first booting the system, I was greeted with some familiar, some unfamiliar UI - While Amazons Fire HD 10 runs Android, itâ€™s heavily modified and limited by Amazon, comes with their own App Store, and doesnâ€™t have any support for any of the original apps. When I downloaded the YouTube app from the Amazon store, it looked as though it was an almost not-wrapped version of the mobile site. But I was used to a streamlined and proper mobile interface for the Android application. So I set out on a long-winded journey to <strong>restore full YouTube access</strong>!</p>

<h3 id="the-failure">The Failure</h3>
<p>So, I thought, hey, just grab yourself an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apk</code> file from one of the many mirrors and just install that - couldnâ€™t be too hard, right? Well, either the app just crashed on boot, or it claimed that it required <em>Google Play Services</em> to function (even though I could see the actual app loaded in the backgroundâ€¦ ðŸ˜¡). I searched the Amazon store for an alternative YouTube client that would suit my needs, but to no avail.</p>

<p>So I realized: If we require Google Play Services, sounds like we need toâ€¦ Provide Google Play Services.</p>

<h3 id="the-success">The Success</h3>
<p>Through some Google-Fu I found a super fresh article that <a href="https://liliputing.com/2017/07/making-amazons-fire-hd-8-2017-googley-play-store-third-party-launchers.html">describes how to googlify the Fire HD 8</a> - 8, 10, what does it matter! The main takeaway from the article is the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire/general/how-to-install-google-play-store-fire-t3486603">4 magic APKs</a> that will install the Google Play Services on your device. So I installed them, and arrived at a point where I could finally use the YouTube app.</p>

<p>But there was one problem that remained for me: <strong>Ads</strong>. I watch a lot of long-winded videos, sometimes to fall asleep to, or just to chill out. There is nothing worse than being interrupted by some loud noises (looking at you, ads for Instagram). So I decided to install <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/">DNS66</a>, an ad blocker that does not require root, yet allows you to system-wide block ads. <em>However, it is incapable of blocking ads in the YouTube app</em>. So I set out on an even deeper journey, determined to get back my best viewing experience!</p>

<h3 id="the-cherry-on-top">The Cherry on Top</h3>
<p>Somebody on XDA Devs was kind enough to upload a <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-g4-plus/themes/app-youtube-red-background-screen-off-t3623852">patched APK</a> which contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Screen off playback</li>
  <li>No ads</li>
  <li>Dark mode</li>
</ul>

<p>When I installed this APK, I really felt like I hit the jackpot.</p>

<p><strong>When installing, make sure not to skip over the installation instructions, and install <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/cn1b36jhjubgqhq/microG_for_YouTube_Vanced_0.2.4.apk">microG</a>!</strong></p>

<p>The only thing left was to install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.lumen&amp;hl=en">CF.lumen</a> for some warm tone colors. Even though it claims it needs some special accessibility options, itâ€™ll work just fine out of the box. However, the actual custom driver requires <em>root</em> - which is the one thing I havenâ€™t gotten on my Fire HD 10 yet. Still holding out though!</p>

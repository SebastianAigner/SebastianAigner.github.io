    <p>I’ve realised that I’ve been falling for something that I’d like to call a bit of an anti-pattern when it comes to how I consume the internet right now. A vicious cycle of endless refreshing, mindless browsing, with no clear goal, or productivity in mind. Let me elaborate on this for a bit. I’m just gonna note down how a typical day looks like in the matter of internet consumption.</p>

<h2 id="a-daily-routine">A Daily Routine</h2>
<h3 id="morning">Morning</h3>
<p>Even before standing up, the first thing is checking my messages, seeing what I missed during those <em>busy</em> eight to twelve hours that I was gone from the surface of the ever-pulsating planet. This usually begins with me opening up whatever app has a red notification bubble; which is usually a nonempty subset of {Telegram, WhatsApp, Mail, iMessage, KakaoTalk}. Then, I open up my mobile browser, and navigate to a randomised sequence of Reddit (my regular frontpage), ProgrammingCircleJerk, Hacker News, and Twitter - not necessarily in this order. This can take me more than 20 minutes (…time that could’ve been wasted snoozing or actually getting the day started). I walk over to the bathroom, phone in hand, shove a toothbrush in my face, all while reading more comments (not to confuse with <em>articles</em>) on Reddit and HN).</p>

<h3 id="during-the-day">During the Day</h3>
<p><em>When in university</em>, I usually use my bathroom breaks to check up on what I feel are the easiest distractions, again HN and Reddit comments jump to the help for a quick endorphin boost while keeping my mind off the thing that I was probably actually working at - where a step back and taking a different angle might have actually helped. Notably, even when I just arrived with the car, I’m still a bit sleepy, it’s cold out, it’s easy to snap the phone out of the holder in the car and just browse one, maybe two comment sections on Reddit, or quickly pull-to-refresh on Twitter.</p>

<p>Depending on whether the lecturer can actually keep my attention (hint: that can be very hard when you’re missing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> on either side), it is easy to swipe to the side on an iPad Pro and quickly drift off into the cozy arms of people talking about cats or net neutrality, where the issues are black and white and I don’t have to remember jack shit.</p>

<p><em>If I stay at home</em>, it gets particularly bad: I usually set out to do some kind of task, but start by very cozily (read: lazily) making myself some breakfast. And breakfast at home means I get to watch a YouTube video, right? Yeah, and then I might end up clicking on a “dank memery” playlist (not linked here for a good reason, otherwise I’d probably have to kiss an hour or two goodbye just by reading this article…), and I waste a lot of time on that. And thanks to the brain being on autopilot, now it just suddenly feels a lot harder to actually get going with whatever I set out to rather than to just maybe refresh the YouTube front page again (<em>I mean, I didn’t spend all the time training the YouTube recommendation algorithm for nothing, right?</em>), and see, maybe it’s going to recommend to me another video from the <a href="https://youtu.be/fRj34o4hN4I?t=17s">Boston Dynamics</a> guys? I can be happy if I get maybe two, or three hours of actual work done - funnily enough it’s often not as stressful as it feels - when you compare it with watching videos about robots doing backflips, that is.</p>

<h3 id="in-the-afternoon">In the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Coming home from uni (or just being at home), it’s almost a reflex that once I switch from my “work machine”, the macbook, to my “free time machine”, the beast of a tower PC I got sitting in my room, I immediately open a few tabs of YouTube, HN, and Reddit. If I’ve been in university, it’s easy to say that “I’ve been working all day” (That may or may not be true, see the paragraph above), so I’ve “earned a break”. However, recently I’ve made the observations that these <em>breaks</em> sometimes expand to fill all the time until I feel too tired to actually start work again (…but some YouTube would be fine though). Which brings me to…</p>

<h3 id="at-night">At Night</h3>
<p>So, during the day, I usually have this (very underwhelming) fantasy of living those two lives, of being the good student through the day, getting all my work out the way, and then being the <em>rockstar software engineer</em> (what a stupid term, but that warrants its own article <em>someday</em>™) at night times, building my own cool projects, everything that I’ve been dreaming of (surprisingly realistic dreams for the most part, if I can just get myself to actually building the thing). This would double benefit me, as I would make a lot of use of my time during the day, and spend whatever energy is left in the evening on my own projects. However, in the moment, YouTube, watching something really mindless because <em>this day was particularly hard</em> and <em>tomorrow’s another day</em> is a mentality that I’ve caught myself using as an excuse more frequently recently, and it worries me. When a new show comes out on Netflix, I often binge watch it, sometimes even with the half-screwed logic that I’m not going to get anything done until I’ve seen all of it anyways, because I’d just procrastinate until I could watch the show again (that’s some magic ass backwards logic right there, but it’s apparently enough to convince myself, so hey)</p>

<h2 id="analysing-the-problem">Analysing the problem</h2>
<p>While I am not a huge fan of TED Talks (they are usually very wishy-washy motivational stuff or people telling you things so generic you could never apply them, but I digress), one talk that has always stuck with me was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp7E973zozc">this talk</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re never going to feel like it. Ever. […] Scientists call it activation energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve also come across another <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/manoush_zomorodi_how_boredom_can_lead_to_your_most_brilliant_ideas#t-107031">TED talk</a> which talks about how we have great ideas when we perform the most mundane tasks - as long as our brains has some leftover capacity (i.e. we’re bored).</p>

<p>Reintroducing boredom in my life seems like something important. Everyone is always stressing out around me, and I feel that in a way distracting myself is a way of just shoving all the problems away, disregarding them, and in return achieving nothing - not my personal goals, not my academic goals (I am talking on a small scale here; say, finish a homework problem early).</p>

<h3 id="content-consumption-hell">Content consumption hell</h3>

<p>It’s <em>incredibly easy</em> to get somewhat high quality entertainment content wherever you are at any time. It’s easy to text people all the time. There’s just no end to it!</p>

<h3 id="on-escapism-and-being-grounded-in-the-real-world">On escapism and being grounded in the real world</h3>
<p>Did I already mention that I am like, super into watching Netflix? I’ve completely transcended movies and moved on to series (in an exaggerated fashion: <em>why would I spend all the time and energy on getting to know some characters only to have them interact maybe two hours on screen?</em> - the mileage in series seems way better here), which once again is a huge time sink, but makes for some great conversation stuff, and is a great filler for whenever you have the slightest feeling of “I don’t know what to do with this time” (a feeling that I should start embracing, see above).</p>

<h2 id="how-to-fix-this">How to fix this?</h2>
<p>Gee, I am really asking myself the <em>difficult and obvious</em> questions here, aren’t I.</p>

<h3 id="recalling-an-old-experiment">Recalling an old experiment</h3>
<p>At some point I channeled enough willpower to actually achieve at least parts of what an ideal time would look like. I used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbkZrOU1Zag">motivational alarm clock</a>, which cut down my standing up time from 20 to three minutes. In the summers, I used to shower cold for extra focus and increased circulation. I’ve done my fair share of watching my calories, eating healthy, and focusing at work. However, it’s always been hard combining multiple of these things at the same time - a few of them at a time are usually not so hard, but combining all of them often leaves me with the problem that while I feel like I’m on the right track, I don’t get things done and use that to (behind my own back) procrastinate once more - just this time in the morning instead of in the afternoon.</p>

<p>However, what I realised is that it is easier for me to actually be productive for my day job (university) when I do it during the day, not during the afternoon or in the evening. It’s fine to extend longer tasks far into the night, but if I don’t get started in the mornings, on some days it feels like I might have just not started at all - it’s demotivating for me to see that it’s already so late, that the thing I set out to do during the day isn’t going to be done any time before the day is more that 80% done - which is unnecessarily disheartening.</p>

<h3 id="formulating-a-new-experiment">Formulating a new experiment</h3>
<p>With christmas coming up, self-control is probably going to be at an all time low: It’s dark outside, it’s cozy under the blankets, hot beverages are available en masse, creating a cozy (and lazy) atmosphere wherever they are up for sale. Long shirts and sweaters make it all to easy to recline into some soft pillows on a chair and just, y’know, <em>chill</em>. But, I still pledge to do my best to uphold a few new standards that should make it easier on myself to maximise the quality of the next few weeks. In this case, <em>quality</em> refers to multiple things:</p>

<h3 id="goals-for-the-new-strategy">Goals for the new strategy</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Family Commitments</strong>: Having a nice Christmas with my family, not being in a stressed out position, seeing things for what they are</li>
  <li><strong>Work</strong>: Properly preparing myself for the upcoming exams. Dedicating a significant chunk of my <em>good</em> wake time to further my academic career. This is going to be one of the main goals to achieve, but also, in turn, probably one of the hardest ones.</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation</strong>: While sounding a bit fluffy, when trying to do a medium-term <em>strategy</em> (as compared to a short-term <em>tactic</em>), it is important that I can keep motivation on a high level. This facilitates me being able to stay on track with my goals and not burning out (i.e. overthrowing my self-imposed regime)</li>
  <li><strong>Fun</strong>: Not only because it’s the holidays, it’s an important secondary factor to <em>motivation</em>. I think it is almost self-explanatory that the more <em>enjoyable</em> I can make the time for myself, the better it will be. This also means deliberately making room for own projects and the things that I enjoy.</li>
  <li><strong>Health</strong>: Overworking, overeating, and too little sleep are all great short-term ways of <em>getting a thing done</em>, but always come at the expense of the next day, week, or month. The strategy has to focus on creating a sustainable healthy lifestyle, which I plan to introduce as evolutionary changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Social</strong>: It is important to stay in touch with people, allow time to hang out and exchange, and refill the social life batteries of myself.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tools-for-the-new-strategy">Tools for the new strategy</h3>

<h4 id="sleep-hygiene">Sleep Hygiene</h4>
<p>For regular days, aim for a <strong>sleep time of 8 hours</strong> with a <strong>bed time of 9 hours</strong> (this includes falling asleep and waking up). On a regular day, the recommended sleep time is <strong>23:00 - 7:00</strong>.</p>

<p>Even for New Year’s, try for <strong>2:00 - 9:30</strong>, as to not turn the whole sleep cycle around.</p>

<h4 id="food-intake">Food Intake</h4>
<p>Limit yourself to three regular-sized meals per day. Unless portions are extremely small, refrain from taking seconds or having two meals in one. Feel free to skip dinner if you’re not feeling hungry (this does not apply to breakfast and lunch, as they provide the fuel for your daily work). While meaty dishes are usually appealing, if given the option, take a <em>more veggie approach</em>.</p>

<p>Substitute snacking with chewing gum. The main part why you snack is because your mouth gets bored and you want to chew on something, so let’s take the zero calorie choice. Alternatives are of course frozen grapes or other extremely low-cal snacks.</p>

<h4 id="drink-intake">Drink Intake</h4>
<p>Try to limit your intake on wine and other alcoholic beverages to a minimum (that is not to say that <em>social situations</em> can’t allow you to have a glass of wine). Limiting consumption of alcoholic beverages helps with standing up the next morning (especially if your body for some magical reason is actually trying to <em>burn</em> the goddamn alcohol).</p>

<h4 id="planning-without-overplanning">Planning without overplanning</h4>
<p>For being able to properly lay out what to do, it is important to <em>figure out what there is to do</em> - that is step zero. From there, make a coarse plan of how much time (in days) which subject gets allocated. The actual day planning is a <em>tactic</em> - unless studying with other people, adapt this as necessary on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<h4 id="meditation-and-mindfulness">Meditation and Mindfulness</h4>
<p>I was contemplating for a long while whether I should include this, but I feel that it is necessary. Keep in mind for yourself that this isn’t the clice “Zen Buddha Om” type of thing. It simply means taking time away from the creation and consumption process, and just being. I’d probably allow music in the background, but staying away from screens, computers, phones is the main point. Introducing boredom, allowing a space for reflection and immediate adjustment is necessary. Try to spend at least 15 minutes per day consciously separated from what you’ve been doing the whole day.</p>

<h4 id="reflection">Reflection</h4>
<p>Spend some time writing down things that worked well and things that didn’t go well. Be brutally honest - only if you are aware that a problem exists, you can fix it. This can be either on a blog, in handwriting (like I’ve done a couple of times on my iPad), or somewhere completely different. This is up to you and most likely also depends on the situation.</p>

<h4 id="using-the-social-circle">Using the social circle</h4>
<p>Talk to people. Tell them ideas. Be inspired by what they have to say. Ask questions.</p>

<h4 id="allowing-time-for-the-things-you-enjoy">Allowing time for the things you enjoy</h4>
<p>It’s not motivating waking up and knowing that the whole day will be spent working on really hard problems that you have a hard time solving. Instead, think of a day as a harmony between the things you have to do and the things you want to do - and hopefully, be able to blur the lines. Find enjoyment in the things for academia, let yourself be consumed by the material at hand, realise and then suppress the upcoming feeling of wanting to do something else.</p>

<h4 id="the-role-of-social-events">The role of social events</h4>
<p>I have not touched on the role of social events in this essay, because I believe that that is something for other times. Social events are in a state of flux for me, and until stuff has settled more (which it may or may not do within the near future), I don’t see much of a point in overanalysing stuff.</p>

<p>I will do my best to use this new strategy in the upcoming weeks. Regardless of the outcome, I shall reflect on this after an implementation attempt sometime in the future.</p>

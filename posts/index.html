Since I want to create more than one thumbnail per media file (hopefully, so that I can do some kind of cool crossfade effect that makes the entire application feel a bit more lively), I opted for the <code>fps</code> video filter. Here&rsquo;s the snippet in my code that creates a thumbnail every 10 seconds into the video. (The snippet here is Kotlin, but they&rsquo;re the literal CLI flags passed to the <code>ffmpeg</code> process, so this should be comprehensible.)</p><h2><a class=post-link href=/posts/2024-12-20-pooling-multiple-drives-with-mergerfs/>Pooling multiple drives on my Raspberry Pi with mergerfs</a></h2><p>My homelab setup is a bit of a mix-and-match of whatever hardware I happen to have lying around.

I was infatuated with the last task we worked on, the <a href=http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/11>Day 11</a> challenge. You are supposed to find the distance of a position in a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_tiling>Hex Grid</a> based on a path description. I had already read a few articles regarding hexagonal grids, because I feel it is one of the less intuitive data structures, but none of them really made me understand the topic extremely well. I decided to just grab a pen and doodle away at a napkin and (later on) a few pieces of paper, scribbling around and trying to figure things out. After I had managed to build an (albeit inefficient) solution for myself, I set out to understand more about the topic. When I managed to have somewhat of a personal breakthrough in understanding, and felt a lot better reasoning about the topic, I decided it would be time to improve upon the visualisations that I had seen on other blogs like <a href=https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/>Redblobgames</a>. They&rsquo;re still a great read any heavily recommended, but I thought I&rsquo;d try my hand at one of these as well.

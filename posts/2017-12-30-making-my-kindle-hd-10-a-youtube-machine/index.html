It should serve as a replacement device for my Sony Xperia Tablet Z which unfortunately had an unplanned rendezvous with the floor.</p><p>So I set out to make this thing my classic YouTube watching machine that I was used to before. Which is when I encountered&mldr;</p><h3 id=the-shock>The Shock</h3><p>Upon first booting the system, I was greeted with some familiar, some unfamiliar UI - While Amazons Fire HD 10 runs Android, it&rsquo;s heavily modified and limited by Amazon, comes with their own App Store, and doesn&rsquo;t have any support for any of the original apps. When I downloaded the YouTube app from the Amazon store, it looked as though it was an almost not-wrapped version of the mobile site. But I was used to a streamlined and proper mobile interface for the Android application. So I set out on a long-winded journey to <strong>restore full YouTube access</strong>!</p><h3 id=the-failure>The Failure</h3><p>So, I thought, hey, just grab yourself an <code>apk</code> file from one of the many mirrors and just install that - couldn&rsquo;t be too hard, right? Well, either the app just crashed on boot, or it claimed that it required <em>Google Play Services</em> to function (even though I could see the actual app loaded in the background&mldr; ðŸ˜¡). I searched the Amazon store for an alternative YouTube client that would suit my needs, but to no avail.</p><p>So I realized: If we require Google Play Services, sounds like we need to&mldr; Provide Google Play Services.</p><h3 id=the-success>The Success</h3><p>Through some Google-Fu I found a super fresh article that <a href=https://liliputing.com/2017/07/making-amazons-fire-hd-8-2017-googley-play-store-third-party-launchers.html>describes how to googlify the Fire HD 8</a> - 8, 10, what does it matter! The main takeaway from the article is the <a href=https://forum.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire/general/how-to-install-google-play-store-fire-t3486603>4 magic APKs</a> that will install the Google Play Services on your device. So I installed them, and arrived at a point where I could finally use the YouTube app.</p><p>But there was one problem that remained for me: <strong>Ads</strong>. I watch a lot of long-winded videos, sometimes to fall asleep to, or just to chill out. There is nothing worse than being interrupted by some loud noises (looking at you, ads for Instagram). So I decided to install <a href=https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/>DNS66</a>, an ad blocker that does not require root, yet allows you to system-wide block ads. <em>However, it is incapable of blocking ads in the YouTube app</em>. So I set out on an even deeper journey, determined to get back my best viewing experience!</p><h3 id=the-cherry-on-top>The Cherry on Top</h3><p>Somebody on XDA Devs was kind enough to upload a <a href=https://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-g4-plus/themes/app-youtube-red-background-screen-off-t3623852>patched APK</a> which contains:</p><ul><li>Screen off playback</li><li>No ads</li><li>Dark mode</li></ul><p>When I installed this APK, I really felt like I hit the jackpot.</p><p><strong>When installing, make sure not to skip over the installation instructions, and install <a href=http://www.mediafire.com/file/cn1b36jhjubgqhq/microG_for_YouTube_Vanced_0.2.4.apk>microG</a>!</strong></p><p>The only thing left was to install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.lumen&amp;hl=en">CF.lumen</a> for some warm tone colors. Even though it claims it needs some special accessibility options, it&rsquo;ll work just fine out of the box. However, the actual custom driver requires <em>root</em> - which is the one thing I haven&rsquo;t gotten on my Fire HD 10 yet. Still holding out though!</p></div></div></main><footer><footer class="site-footer h-card"><data class=u-url href></data><div class=wrapper><div class=footer-col-wrapper><div class=footer-col><p class=feed-subscribe><svg class="svg-icon orange"/><span>Subscribe</span></a></p><ul class=contact-list></ul></div><div class=footer-col><p>Thanks for stopping by my corner of the internet :)</p></div></div></div></footer></footer></body></html>

## Adding more Checkvist to my life (2024-05-03)

I've decided it's an easy way to get a CMS-like experience for writing these small blog posts.

By integrating with Checkvist, I can write what I'd consider a unified interface pretty much whenever. So far, by simply keeping this a one-pager, it also means I can edit the entire thing on-the-go, and make small changes (and keep things incremental). I'm writing all of this in a [Checkvist](https://checkvist.com/) outline, and then just have a small tool that syncs the markdown output into the GitHub repo that powers my website. The first version of this tool lives in the [Checkmate repo](https://github.com/SebastianAigner/checkmate/blob/ae8fe63172386d4742a20eee113c51434b2d2d8d/composeApp/src/desktopMain/kotlin/checksync.kt) -- which is still private right now, but that may change in the future.

Today, we&amp;rsquo;re talking all about lists! Lists are the most popular collection type in Kotlin for a good reason, and we’ll find out why together.
Lists What’s a list? If you&amp;rsquo;ve written Kotlin code before, you&amp;rsquo;ve definitely seen a list – they&amp;rsquo;re collections of ordered elements, where each element is accessible via an index.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Kotlin Collection Functionality</title><link>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-06-14-advanced-kotlin-collection-functionality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-06-14-advanced-kotlin-collection-functionality/</guid><description>This blog post accompanies a video from our YouTube series which you can find on our Kotlin YouTube channel, or watch here directly!
Today, we are learning about advanced functions that we can use to work with and manipulate all kinds of Kotlin collections!
Checking predicates: any, none and all Let’s warm up by having a look at a selection of functions that allow us to check conditions for our collection elements.</description></item><item><title>How I built an "Asteroids" game using Compose for Desktop (Part 1/2)</title><link>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-05-06-asteroids-in-compose-for-desktop/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-05-06-asteroids-in-compose-for-desktop/</guid><description>A while ago, I tweeted about a small game I had created on top of Compose for Desktop: A small clone of the classic arcade game Asteroids, in which you control a space ship with your mouse, and navigate the vastness of space, avoiding and breaking asteroids in the process.
Today, it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a look under the hood and understand how I built a basic version of this game, and how Compose for Desktop helped me achieve it in just one evening!</description></item><item><title>Tips &amp; tricks for building a game using Compose for Desktop (Part 2/2)</title><link>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-05-06-tips-and-tricks-building-a-game-in-compose-for-desktop/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-05-06-tips-and-tricks-building-a-game-in-compose-for-desktop/</guid><description>In the first part of my blog post series about building a small clone of the classic arcade game Asteroids on top of Compose for Desktop, we saw how to implement the main game loop, as well as manage state and draw basic shapes. In this post, we will explore some more details of the game implementation. This includes:
Rendering details – making sure game objects don&amp;rsquo;t escape our play area, and using a device-independent coordinate system for rendering Geometry and linear algebra – the secret sauce that makes the space ships fly Frame-independent movement – so that our game works consistently.</description></item><item><title>Diving into Kotlin collections</title><link>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-03-29-diving-into-kotlin-collections/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-03-29-diving-into-kotlin-collections/</guid><description>This blog post accompanies a video from our YouTube series which you can find on our Kotlin YouTube channel, or watch here directly!
Kotlin Collections! You’ve heard of them, you’ve used them – so it makes sense to learn even more about them! Kotlin&amp;rsquo;s standard library provides awesome tools to manage groups of items, and we’re going to take a closer look!
Let&amp;rsquo;s see what types of collections the Kotlin standard library offers, and explore a common subset of operations that’s available for all of the collections you get in the standard library.</description></item></channel></rss>

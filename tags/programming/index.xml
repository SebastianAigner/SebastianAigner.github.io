Today, we&amp;rsquo;re talking all about lists! Lists are the most popular collection type in Kotlin for a good reason, and we’ll find out why together.
Lists What’s a list? If you&amp;rsquo;ve written Kotlin code before, you&amp;rsquo;ve definitely seen a list – they&amp;rsquo;re collections of ordered elements, where each element is accessible via an index.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Kotlin Collection Functionality</title><link>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-06-14-advanced-kotlin-collection-functionality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-06-14-advanced-kotlin-collection-functionality/</guid><description>This blog post accompanies a video from our YouTube series which you can find on our Kotlin YouTube channel, or watch here directly!
Today, we are learning about advanced functions that we can use to work with and manipulate all kinds of Kotlin collections!
Checking predicates: any, none and all Let’s warm up by having a look at a selection of functions that allow us to check conditions for our collection elements.</description></item><item><title>Diving into Kotlin collections</title><link>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-03-29-diving-into-kotlin-collections/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-03-29-diving-into-kotlin-collections/</guid><description>This blog post accompanies a video from our YouTube series which you can find on our Kotlin YouTube channel, or watch here directly!
Kotlin Collections! You’ve heard of them, you’ve used them – so it makes sense to learn even more about them! Kotlin&amp;rsquo;s standard library provides awesome tools to manage groups of items, and we’re going to take a closer look!
Let&amp;rsquo;s see what types of collections the Kotlin standard library offers, and explore a common subset of operations that’s available for all of the collections you get in the standard library.</description></item><item><title>Kotlin Standard Library Safari: Strings</title><link>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-03-11-kotlin-stdlib-safari-strings/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 19:33:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sebi.io/posts/2021-03-11-kotlin-stdlib-safari-strings/</guid><description>This blog post accompanies the first episode of our YouTube series &amp;ldquo;Kotlin Standard Library Safari&amp;rdquo;, which you can find on the official Kotlin YouTube channel, or watch here directly!

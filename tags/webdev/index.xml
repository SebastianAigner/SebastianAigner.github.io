Read on to learn how you can build and test your application on GitHub&amp;rsquo;s CI, and get your Kotlin/JS web apps published for free.
In this post, we are going to configure GitHub Actions and Pages so that new code pushed to our repository or added via pull request is automatically validated (by having the project built and our tests run on GitHub&amp;rsquo;s servers), and code pushed to the main branch of our project is automatically made available to the public (by generating and publishing production artifacts of our app).</description></item></channel></rss>
